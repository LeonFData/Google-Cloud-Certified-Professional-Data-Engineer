# Google-Cloud-Certified-Professional-Data-Engineer

I took this course to prepare myself for the certification exam. As google product user, I felt exciting to explore more Google Cloud's data services, excercise them on the hands-on labs and put those systems to my fulltime work as reasearch data scientist. Google cloud products improved my work efficiently at large scale data storage, data cleaning and modeling.
