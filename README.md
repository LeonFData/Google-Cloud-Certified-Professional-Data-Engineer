# Google-Cloud-Certified-Professional-Data-Engineer

I took this course to prepare myself for the certification exam. As google product user, I felt exciting to explore more Google Cloud's data services, excercise them on the hands-on labs and put those systems to my fulltime work as reasearch data scientist. Google cloud products improved my work efficiently at large scale data storage, data cleaning and modeling. 

# My study materials ([MOOC](https://linuxacademy.com/course/google-cloud-certified-professional-data-engineer/))
* Digital hand-written notes on Dossier [(part1)](dossier_notes/Dossier_notes_part1.pdf) [(part2)](dossier_notes/Dossier_notes_part2.pdf)
* [Course notes](course_hands_on_exercises.pdf) (In-course hands-on excercises)
* [Lab Notes](Labs) (Guides  with step-by-step instructions) 
* A 12-month, $300 trial program (assess to all GCP products for free)

# Study Path
1. Since GCP has a whole bunch of services and products, I decided to go along the course videos and tried to get familiar to them quickly;
2. Read more study cases, learn why and how to implement a specific GCP product.
3. By doing the hands-on labs and little quizzes, I was getting more comfortable to the concept, configuration, setting and working machenism for each topic.
4. By taking the [official practise exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/practice-exam/data-engineer), I learnt more from the mistakes from the questions and review those important parts that I was not good at.
5. As I learnt more, I transfered part of my local work to GCP. My daily coding job was upgraded, GCP did some work for me! I learnt more about GCP at the same moment.
6. Practice, practice and practice. Waiting for the coming exam.
